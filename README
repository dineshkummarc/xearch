Usage
--------------------
To use this tool you should only have to do the following.

- Put the files in the xearch directory under modules.
- Add 'xearch' to your list of modules in your app.properties file for your application.
- Create a Xearch prototype within your application and make sure that 'search_results' is called from within that prototypes main function.

--------------------
Skinning
--------------------
There is not yet a notion of a main wrapper function (tal or JS). Thus, you need to create one. I'll likely have to include one at some point so look for it in the future.
